# PRD: Data Validation and Error Resolution System

## Overview

Build a comprehensive validation system that enforces target shape rules during and after the column mapping process. The system will track validation errors and warnings at both row and cell levels, providing users with tools to filter, identify, and resolve data quality issues systematically.

## Problem Statement

Currently, users can import and map data without validation against target shape constraints. This leads to:
- Invalid data passing through undetected (missing required fields, wrong types)
- Enum/lookup mismatches not being flagged
- No systematic way to identify and fix data quality issues
- Users discovering validation problems only at export or downstream processing

## Solution Overview

Create a validation engine that:
1. Validates data against target shape rules after column mapping
2. Tracks errors/warnings at row and cell granularity via metadata
3. Provides filtering and navigation tools for error resolution
4. Offers inline editing capabilities for fixing validation issues
5. Shows validation status and progress indicators

## User Stories

### Core Validation
- **As a user**, I want data to be validated against my target shape rules so invalid data is caught early
- **As a user**, I want to see which rows have validation errors so I can focus on problem areas
- **As a user**, I want to see specific cell-level errors so I know exactly what to fix

### Error Discovery & Navigation  
- **As a user**, I want to filter the table to "show only errors" so I can work through issues systematically
- **As a user**, I want to see error counts and validation progress so I know how much work remains
- **As a user**, I want to navigate between error rows efficiently so I don't miss any issues

### Error Resolution
- **As a user**, I want to edit cells with validation errors inline so I can fix issues quickly
- **As a user**, I want suggested fixes for common validation errors so resolution is faster
- **As a user**, I want validation to re-run after edits so I get immediate feedback

### Reporting & Status
- **As a user**, I want a validation summary dashboard so I understand overall data quality
- **As a user**, I want to export validation reports so I can share data quality status
- **As a user**, I want validation status to persist so I don't lose progress when switching views

## Technical Requirements

### Validation Engine Architecture

#### Core Validation Rules
```typescript
interface ValidationRule {
  id: string;
  type: 'required' | 'type' | 'enum' | 'lookup' | 'format' | 'range';
  severity: 'error' | 'warning';
  field: string;
  message: string;
  suggestedFix?: string;
}

interface ValidationResult {
  isValid: boolean;
  errors: ValidationError[];
  warnings: ValidationWarning[];
  metadata: {
    validatedAt: string;
    validationVersion: string;
  };
}
```

#### Validation Types to Support

**1. Required Field Validation**
- Rule: Field marked as `required: true` in target shape
- Error: Cell is empty/null/undefined
- Fix: Prompt user to enter value or mark as optional

**2. Data Type Validation** 
- Rule: Field type (string, number, integer, date, currency, etc.)
- Error: Value doesn't match expected type
- Fix: Suggest type conversion or allow user to correct

**3. Enum Value Validation**
- Rule: Value must be in enum options list
- Error: Value not found in allowed options
- Fix: Suggest closest match or allow adding to enum

**4. Lookup Value Validation**
- Rule: Value must exist in reference data
- Error: No match found in lookup data
- Fix: Show fuzzy matches or allow reference data updates

**5. Format Validation**
- Rule: Email, phone, URL format patterns
- Error: Value doesn't match expected format  
- Fix: Suggest format corrections

**6. Range/Length Validation**
- Rule: Min/max values, string length limits
- Error: Value outside allowed range
- Fix: Suggest valid range or allow override

### Metadata Architecture

#### Row-Level Metadata
```typescript
interface RowValidationMetadata {
  rowId: string;
  hasErrors: boolean;
  hasWarnings: boolean;
  errorCount: number;
  warningCount: number;
  lastValidated: string;
  status: 'valid' | 'errors' | 'warnings' | 'not_validated';
}
```

#### Cell-Level Metadata
```typescript
interface CellValidationMetadata {
  rowId: string;
  fieldName: string;
  hasErrors: boolean;
  hasWarnings: boolean;
  errors: ValidationError[];
  warnings: ValidationWarning[];
  suggestedFixes: SuggestedFix[];
  lastValidated: string;
}
```

### UI Components

#### Validation Status Indicators
- **Row Status Icons**: Error/warning indicators in row headers
- **Cell Status Indicators**: Red border/background for errors, yellow for warnings
- **Validation Badge**: Show error/warning counts in data table header
- **Progress Indicator**: "X of Y rows validated, N errors remaining"

#### Filtering & Navigation
- **Error Filter Toggle**: "Show only rows with errors"
- **Validation Status Filter**: Dropdown for "All", "Valid", "Errors", "Warnings" 
- **Next/Previous Error Navigation**: Jump between error rows
- **Error Type Filter**: Filter by specific validation rule types

#### Error Resolution Interface
- **Validation Panel**: Expandable side panel showing all errors for selected row
- **Inline Error Messages**: Tooltips/popovers on error cells showing issue details
- **Quick Fix Actions**: One-click fixes for common issues (type conversion, format correction)
- **Bulk Fix Operations**: Apply same fix to multiple similar errors

#### Validation Dashboard
- **Summary Statistics**: Total rows, valid rows, error counts by type
- **Validation Progress**: Visual progress bar and completion percentage
- **Error Breakdown**: Chart showing error types and frequencies
- **Export Options**: Download validation report as CSV/JSON

## Conclusion

This validation system will transform the data import experience by catching data quality issues early and providing systematic tools for resolution. By implementing validation at the right point in the workflow (after column mapping) and providing granular error tracking, users will be able to ensure data quality before export while maintaining productivity through efficient error resolution tools.

The phased approach allows for incremental delivery of value while building toward a comprehensive data quality solution that scales with user needs and dataset complexity.
