## Contributing to Patterns

When implementing new features or refactoring existing code:

1. **Document New Patterns** - If you develop reusable patterns, add them to the appropriate document
2. **Update Examples** - Keep code examples current with the latest implementations
3. **Test Documentation** - Ensure code examples work and are tested
4. **Cross-Reference** - Link between related patterns across documents

## Pattern Evolution

These patterns are living documents that evolve with the codebase:

- **Version 1.0** - Established during lookup fields implementation (LOOKUP-001 to LOOKUP-009)
- **Future Versions** - Will incorporate learnings from new feature implementations
