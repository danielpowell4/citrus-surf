# Citrus Surf Importer - Cursor Rules

## Project Context

Before starting any work, ALWAYS read and understand:

1. `CONTEXT.md` - Product vision, architecture, and sprint goals
2. `docs/` directory - Technical documentation for existing systems
3. `README.md` - Project setup and basic usage

## Key Principles

- This is a workflow-first CSV importer and data prep tool
- "Life's short, go surfing" - prioritize speed and simplicity
- Focus on transparency, debuggability, resilience, and speed
- Current MVP: client-side app with TanStack Table, Redux Toolkit, Next.js

## Architecture Guidelines

- Frontend: React + Next.js + Tailwind + shadcn/ui
- State: Redux Toolkit + Redux Saga
- Grid: TanStack Table
- Export: Client-side CSV/JSON download

## Code Style

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase
- Prefer functional components with hooks
- Use shadcn/ui components when possible
- Maintain responsive design principles
