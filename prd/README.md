# Product Requirements Documents (PRDs)

This directory contains comprehensive PRDs for major features, broken down into implementable tickets with specific acceptance criteria and context.

## Structure

- `lookup-fields/` - Lookup/Reference field type implementation
  - `prd.md` - Main PRD overview
  - `tickets/` - Individual implementation tickets
  - `research/` - Technical research and decisions

## How to Use

1. **Read the main PRD** (`{feature}/prd.md`) for overall context and requirements
2. **Review tickets** (`{feature}/tickets/`) for specific implementation tasks
3. **Check dependencies** between tickets for proper sequencing
4. **Update ticket status** as work progresses

## Ticket Format

Each ticket follows a consistent format:

- **Context**: Why this work is needed
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Specific requirements that must be met
- **Technical Notes**: Implementation guidance and considerations
- **Dependencies**: Other tickets or features this depends on
- **Estimated Effort**: Rough sizing (S/M/L/XL)
