# VS-002: Validation Engine Core Implementation

## Context

Build the core validation engine that can run validation rules against table data and generate validation results with metadata. The engine must support pluggable rules, async processing, and handle 10k+ rows efficiently.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Validation Engine Class ✅

- [x] Create `ValidationEngine` class in `lib/utils/validation-engine.ts`
- [x] Implement `validateRow(row: TableRow, targetShape: TargetShape): ValidationResult` method
- [x] Implement `validateTable(data: TableRow[], targetShape: TargetShape): ValidationState` method
- [x] Implement `validateCell(value: any, field: TargetField, rowData: TableRow): ValidationResult` method

### AC2: Rule Registry System ✅

- [x] Create `ValidationRuleRegistry` class to manage available validation rules
- [x] Implement `registerRule(rule: ValidationRule): void` method
- [x] Implement `getRule(ruleId: string): ValidationRule` method
- [x] Implement `getRulesForField(field: TargetField): ValidationRule[]` method

### AC3: Base Rule Implementation ✅

- [x] Create abstract `BaseValidationRule` class
- [x] Implement `validate(value: any, field: TargetField, context: ValidationContext): ValidationResult` abstract method
- [x] Include rule metadata: id, type, severity, description
- [x] Include `createSuggestedFix(value: any, field: TargetField): SuggestedFix` method

### AC4: Performance Optimizations ✅

- [x] Implement async validation with `validateTableAsync` method
- [x] Add progress callback support for large datasets
- [x] Include early exit optimization for valid data
- [x] Cache validation results for unchanged data

## Technical Requirements ✅

- Engine must handle 10,000+ rows without blocking UI thread
- Validation rules must be pluggable and extensible
- Error handling for malformed input data
- Memory-efficient processing for large datasets

## Testing Requirements ✅

- [x] Unit tests for ValidationEngine class methods with 100% coverage (30 tests)
- [x] Integration tests with sample target shapes and data
- [x] Performance tests with 10k+ row datasets (<5s validation time) 
- [x] Error handling tests for edge cases (null data, missing fields)
- [x] All tests must pass: `npm run test lib/utils/validation-engine*.test.ts`

## Lint Requirements ✅

- [x] All code must pass: `npm run lint`
- [x] No TypeScript errors: `npm run typecheck`
- [x] JSDoc comments for all public methods

## Performance Benchmarks ✅

**Requirements vs Achieved:**
- **10,000 rows**: <5s requirement → **66ms achieved** (76x faster)
- **Single row**: **0.007ms average**
- **Single cell**: **0.0017ms average**
- **Memory usage**: <500MB requirement → **Negative memory growth**
- **Async processing**: **101 progress updates for 10k rows**

**Key Optimizations:**
- Chunked processing for UI thread yielding
- Efficient rule registry with type-based indexing
- Early exit for valid data
- Graceful error handling for rule failures

## Implementation Notes

**Files Created:**
- `lib/utils/validation-engine.ts` - Core validation engine and rule registry
- `lib/utils/validation-engine.test.ts` - Comprehensive engine tests (30 tests)
- `lib/utils/validation-engine-performance.test.ts` - Performance benchmarks (7 tests)

**Key Features:**
- **Pluggable Architecture**: BaseValidationRule abstract class for extensible rules
- **Rule Registry**: Efficient rule management with type-based indexing
- **Async Processing**: Non-blocking validation with progress callbacks
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of rule execution failures
- **Statistics Generation**: Automatic summary statistics and problematic field identification

**Integration Points:**
- Seamless integration with VS-001 validation types
- Compatible with existing TargetShape and TableRow systems
- Ready for Redux integration in VS-006

## Status: ✅ Complete

High-performance validation engine established with pluggable rule architecture, exceeding performance requirements by 76x. Ready for specific validation rule implementation and UI integration.
