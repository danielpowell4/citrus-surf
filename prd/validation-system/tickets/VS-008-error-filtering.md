# VS-008: Error Filtering and Navigation

## Context

Build filtering and navigation tools that allow users to systematically find, review, and resolve validation errors across large datasets with efficient keyboard and mouse workflows.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Error Filtering Interface

- [ ] "Show Errors Only" toggle filter
- [ ] "Show Warnings Only" toggle filter
- [ ] "Show Valid Rows Only" toggle filter
- [ ] Combined filter states (errors + warnings)
- [ ] Filter state persistence during session

### AC2: Error Navigation Controls

- [ ] "Next Error" navigation button
- [ ] "Previous Error" navigation button
- [ ] Jump to first/last error buttons
- [ ] Error counter display (e.g., "3 of 47 errors")
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts for error navigation (Ctrl+E, Ctrl+Shift+E)

### AC3: Advanced Filtering

- [ ] Filter by validation rule type (required, type, enum, etc.)
- [ ] Filter by specific field/column
- [ ] Filter by error severity (error vs warning)
- [ ] Search within error messages
- [ ] Multiple filter combination support

### AC4: Navigation Behavior

- [ ] Auto-scroll to bring error rows into view
- [ ] Focus management for keyboard navigation
- [ ] Visual highlighting of current error in navigation
- [ ] Skip resolved errors during navigation
- [ ] Wrap-around navigation at dataset boundaries

## Technical Requirements

- Integrate with existing table filtering infrastructure
- Maintain filter state in Redux store
- Efficient filtering for large datasets
- Smooth scrolling and focus management

## Testing Requirements

- [ ] Test basic error/warning filtering functionality
- [ ] Test error navigation controls and keyboard shortcuts
- [ ] Test advanced filtering combinations
- [ ] Test auto-scroll and focus management
- [ ] Test filter state persistence
- [ ] Test performance with large datasets
- [ ] All tests must pass: `npm run test components/error-filtering.test.tsx`

## Lint Requirements

- [ ] All code must pass: `npm run lint`
- [ ] No TypeScript errors: `npm run typecheck`
- [ ] Follow existing filtering patterns

## Status: ðŸ“‹ Planned

Core workflow component enabling systematic error resolution across datasets.
