# Validation System PRD

## Executive Summary

Build a comprehensive data validation and error resolution system that enforces target shape rules during and after the column mapping process. The system tracks validation errors and warnings at both row and cell levels, providing users with tools to filter, identify, and resolve data quality issues systematically.

## Problem Statement

Currently, users can import and map data without validation against target shape constraints. This leads to:

- **Invalid data passing through undetected** (missing required fields, wrong types)
- **Enum/lookup mismatches not being flagged** during data processing
- **No systematic way to identify and fix data quality issues**
- **Users discovering validation problems only at export** or downstream processing
- **Manual, time-consuming error discovery and resolution**

## Solution Overview

Create a validation engine that:

1. **Validates data against target shape rules** after column mapping
2. **Tracks errors/warnings at row and cell granularity** via metadata
3. **Provides filtering and navigation tools** for error resolution
4. **Offers inline editing capabilities** for fixing validation issues
5. **Shows validation status and progress indicators** throughout the workflow

## Success Metrics

### User Experience Metrics
- **Error Discovery Time**: <30 seconds from import to identifying all validation issues
- **Error Resolution Rate**: >90% of validation errors successfully resolved
- **User Satisfaction**: >4.5/5 rating on validation workflow usability

### Technical Metrics
- **Validation Performance**: <5 seconds to validate 10k+ row datasets
- **Error Detection Accuracy**: <5% false positive/negative rates for validation rules
- **System Reliability**: 99%+ validation consistency across repeated runs

### Business Metrics
- **Data Quality Improvement**: 50%+ reduction in downstream data processing errors
- **User Adoption**: >80% usage rate of validation features by active users
- **Support Reduction**: 40%+ decrease in support tickets related to data quality issues

## User Stories

### Core Validation
- **As a user**, I want data to be validated against my target shape rules so invalid data is caught early
- **As a user**, I want to see which rows have validation errors so I can focus on problem areas
- **As a user**, I want to see specific cell-level errors so I know exactly what to fix

### Error Discovery & Navigation  
- **As a user**, I want to filter the table to "show only errors" so I can work through issues systematically
- **As a user**, I want to see error counts and validation progress so I know how much work remains
- **As a user**, I want to navigate between error rows efficiently so I don't miss any issues

### Error Resolution
- **As a user**, I want to edit cells with validation errors inline so I can fix issues quickly
- **As a user**, I want suggested fixes for common validation errors so resolution is faster
- **As a user**, I want validation to re-run after edits so I get immediate feedback

### Reporting & Status
- **As a user**, I want a validation summary dashboard so I understand overall data quality
- **As a user**, I want to export validation reports so I can share data quality status
- **As a user**, I want validation status to persist so I don't lose progress when switching views

## Technical Architecture

### Validation Engine Core
- **Pluggable Rule System**: Extensible validation rules with unified interface
- **Performance Optimized**: Handle 10k+ rows in <5 seconds with async processing
- **Error Handling**: Graceful failure recovery and detailed error reporting
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time validation progress for large datasets

### Metadata Architecture
- **Row-Level Tracking**: Validation status, error/warning counts, last validated timestamp
- **Cell-Level Details**: Specific errors, suggested fixes, validation rule applied
- **Redux Integration**: Seamless state management with existing table system
- **Persistence**: Validation state survives page refreshes and navigation

### UI Components
- **Status Indicators**: Visual error/warning markers on rows and cells
- **Filtering Tools**: "Show only errors", validation status filters, error type filters
- **Resolution Interface**: Inline editing, suggested fixes, bulk operations
- **Progress Dashboard**: Validation statistics, completion tracking, export capabilities

## Validation Rules Supported

### Required Field Validation
- **Rule**: Field marked as `required: true` in target shape
- **Error**: Cell is empty/null/undefined
- **Fix**: Prompt user to enter value or mark as optional

### Data Type Validation
- **Rule**: Field type (string, number, integer, date, currency, etc.)
- **Error**: Value doesn't match expected type
- **Fix**: Suggest type conversion or allow user to correct

### Enum Value Validation
- **Rule**: Value must be in enum options list
- **Error**: Value not found in allowed options
- **Fix**: Suggest closest match or allow adding to enum

### Lookup Value Validation
- **Rule**: Value must exist in reference data
- **Error**: No match found in lookup data
- **Fix**: Show fuzzy matches or allow reference data updates

### Format Validation
- **Rule**: Email, phone, URL format patterns
- **Error**: Value doesn't match expected format
- **Fix**: Suggest format corrections

### Range/Length Validation
- **Rule**: Min/max values, string length limits
- **Error**: Value outside allowed range
- **Fix**: Suggest valid range or allow override

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (2 weeks)
- Core validation types and metadata schema
- Validation engine with pluggable rule system
- Redux integration for state management

### Phase 2: Core Rules (2 weeks)
- Required field validation implementation
- Data type validation with conversion support
- Enum value validation with fuzzy matching

### Phase 3: User Interface (2 weeks)
- Visual validation indicators and status display
- Error filtering and navigation controls
- Inline error resolution interface

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (2 weeks)
- Validation dashboard and reporting
- Bulk error resolution operations
- Export functionality for validation reports

## Risk Mitigation

### Performance Risks
- **Risk**: Validation slows down large dataset processing
- **Mitigation**: Implement async validation with progress indicators, optimize rule engines

### Usability Risks
- **Risk**: Complex validation interface overwhelming for users
- **Mitigation**: Progressive disclosure, contextual help, guided error resolution workflows

### Data Quality Risks
- **Risk**: False positives cause users to "fix" valid data
- **Mitigation**: Clear validation rule explanations, confidence scores, user override options

## Future Enhancements

### Advanced Validation Features
- **Cross-field validation**: Rules that validate relationships between multiple fields
- **Statistical validation**: Outlier detection, data distribution analysis
- **ML-powered validation**: Learn validation patterns from user corrections

### Integration Opportunities
- **External validation services**: Integration with data quality tools
- **Workflow integration**: Connect validation to approval/review processes
- **Real-time validation**: Stream processing for live data validation

This validation system transforms the data import experience by catching data quality issues early and providing systematic tools for resolution, ensuring data quality before export while maintaining productivity through efficient error resolution workflows.
