# Lookup Fields Implementation Roadmap

## Overview

This roadmap breaks down the lookup fields implementation into logical phases with clear dependencies and milestones. Each phase builds upon the previous, ensuring a stable and iterative development process.

## Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)
**Goal**: Establish core infrastructure and type system

### Week 1: Core Types & Data Management
- **LOOKUP-001**: Core Type Definitions (2 days)
- **LOOKUP-002**: Reference Data Manager (3 days)

### Week 2: Integration & Validation  
- **LOOKUP-003**: Target Shapes Integration (3 days)
- **LOOKUP-006**: Enhanced Validation System (2 days)

**Milestone**: Basic lookup field configuration and reference data management working

## Phase 2: Processing Engine (Week 3-4)
**Goal**: Implement matching algorithms and data processing

### Week 3: Matching Engine
- **LOOKUP-004**: Lookup Matching Engine (5 days)

### Week 4: Data Processing
- **LOOKUP-005**: Data Processing Integration (5 days)

**Milestone**: Lookup processing working end-to-end with basic UI

## Phase 3: User Interface (Week 5-6)
**Goal**: Build comprehensive user interfaces

### Week 5: Core UI Components
- **LOOKUP-007**: Lookup Editable Cell Component (5 days)

### Week 6: Management Interfaces
- **LOOKUP-008**: Reference Data Viewer & Editor (5 days)
- **LOOKUP-011**: Routing and Navigation Patterns (3 days, parallel)

**Milestone**: Complete user interface for lookup functionality

## Phase 4: Advanced Features (Week 7-8)
**Goal**: Add advanced features and template integration

### Week 7: Template Integration & Review UI
- **LOOKUP-009**: Template Builder Integration (4 days)
- **LOOKUP-010**: Fuzzy Match Review UI (3 days, parallel)

### Week 8: Integration & Polish
- **LOOKUP-012**: Integration and Polish (5 days)

**Milestone**: Feature-complete lookup system ready for production

## Dependencies

### Critical Path
```
LOOKUP-001 → LOOKUP-002 → LOOKUP-003 → LOOKUP-004 → LOOKUP-005 → LOOKUP-007 → LOOKUP-012
```

### Parallel Development Opportunities
- **LOOKUP-006** can be developed parallel to LOOKUP-003
- **LOOKUP-008** and **LOOKUP-011** can be developed parallel to each other
- **LOOKUP-009** and **LOOKUP-010** can be developed parallel to each other

### External Dependencies
- Existing target shapes system (stable)
- TanStack Table integration (stable)
- Redux store and history system (stable)
- Next.js App Router (stable)

## Risk Management

### High Risk Items
1. **Performance with large datasets** (LOOKUP-004)
   - Mitigation: Implement incremental matching and caching
   - Fallback: Progressive loading and pagination

2. **Complex Redux history integration** (Multiple tickets)
   - Mitigation: Thorough testing at each phase
   - Fallback: Simplified history tracking if needed

3. **UI complexity for fuzzy matching** (LOOKUP-010)
   - Mitigation: Progressive disclosure and good UX design
   - Fallback: Simplified approve/reject interface

### Medium Risk Items
1. **Reference data editing complexity** (LOOKUP-008)
2. **Template builder integration** (LOOKUP-009)
3. **Cross-component state management** (LOOKUP-012)

## Quality Gates

### Phase 1 Gate
- [ ] All core types compile and validate correctly
- [ ] Reference data upload, storage, and retrieval works
- [ ] Target shapes can be created with lookup fields
- [ ] Basic validation rules generate from reference data

### Phase 2 Gate
- [ ] Matching engine handles exact, normalized, and fuzzy matching
- [ ] Data processing integrates with existing import pipeline
- [ ] Large dataset performance is acceptable (>1k rows)
- [ ] Error handling is robust for edge cases

### Phase 3 Gate
- [ ] Lookup editable cells work in data table
- [ ] Reference data can be viewed and edited
- [ ] Navigation patterns follow app conventions
- [ ] All UI components are accessible

### Phase 4 Gate
- [ ] Template builder supports lookup field creation
- [ ] Fuzzy match review workflow is complete
- [ ] End-to-end workflows are tested and working
- [ ] Performance is optimized for production use
