# Lookup Fields PRD

## Executive Summary

Implement a new "lookup" field type that provides Excel VLOOKUP-style functionality with intelligent matching, automatic data enrichment, and transparent reference data management. This eliminates the complexity of Excel formulas while providing superior error handling and user experience.

## Problem Statement

Users frequently need to enrich CSV data by cross-referencing against other datasets (like converting department names to department IDs for database imports). Currently, this requires:

- Complex Excel VLOOKUP formulas that are error-prone
- Manual data cleanup for mismatches
- No visibility into reference data sources
- No handling of fuzzy/near matches

## Solution Overview

A new `lookup` field type that:

1. **Matches input data** against reference files with smart algorithms
2. **Enriches data** with additional columns automatically
3. **Handles fuzzy matches** with confidence scoring
4. **Provides transparency** into reference data sources
5. **Enables reference data editing** directly in the workflow

## Success Metrics

- **Zero formulas required** (vs Excel VLOOKUP complexity)
- **95%+ auto-match rate** with smart normalization
- **<30 seconds** to configure typical lookup workflow
- **Clear error resolution** for unmatched data

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Lookup Field Type** - New field type in target shapes system
2. **Matching Engine** - Exact, normalized, and fuzzy matching algorithms
3. **Reference Data Manager** - Upload, view, and edit reference files
4. **UI Components** - Enhanced editable cells with lookup functionality
5. **Validation Integration** - Auto-generated enum validation from reference data

### Data Flow

```
Input Data → Lookup Configuration → Matching Engine → Enriched Output
     ↑              ↓
Reference Data ← Data Manager
```

## Feature Breakdown

See individual tickets in the `tickets/` directory for detailed implementation requirements:

1. **Core Type System** (`LOOKUP-001` to `LOOKUP-003`)
2. **Matching Engine** (`LOOKUP-004` to `LOOKUP-006`)
3. **UI Components** (`LOOKUP-007` to `LOOKUP-010`)
4. **Integration & Polish** (`LOOKUP-011` to `LOOKUP-013`)

## Dependencies

- Existing target shapes system
- Current editable cell framework
- TanStack Table integration
- Validation system

## Timeline

**Phase 1** (Core): LOOKUP-001 through LOOKUP-006 (Foundation + Matching)
**Phase 2** (UI): LOOKUP-007 through LOOKUP-010 (User Interface)  
**Phase 3** (Polish): LOOKUP-011 through LOOKUP-013 (Integration + Enhancement)

Estimated total: **4-6 weeks** for complete implementation

## Risk Mitigation

- **Performance**: Implement efficient matching algorithms for large datasets
- **UX Complexity**: Progressive disclosure of advanced features
- **Data Quality**: Robust error handling and validation
- **Integration**: Careful testing with existing target shapes system
