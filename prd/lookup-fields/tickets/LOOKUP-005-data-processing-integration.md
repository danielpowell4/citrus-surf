# LOOKUP-005: Data Processing Integration

## Context

Integrate the lookup matching engine with the existing data processing pipeline. This ensures lookup operations happen automatically when data is imported or edited, and derived columns are updated accordingly.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Data Import Integration

- [x] Automatically perform lookups when target shape has lookup fields
- [x] Process all lookup fields during data import workflow
- [x] Generate derived columns in the final dataset
- [x] Handle lookup errors gracefully during import

### AC2: Real-time Updates

- [x] Trigger lookup when user edits lookup field values
- [x] Update derived columns immediately when source lookup changes
- [x] Maintain data consistency across all related fields

### AC3: Batch Processing

- [x] Efficient processing of large datasets with lookups
- [x] Progress indicators for long-running lookup operations
- [x] Memory management for large reference datasets

### AC4: Error Handling & Reporting

- [x] Collect and report unmatched values with suggestions
- [x] Provide summary statistics (X/Y matched, Z errors)
- [x] Allow user review/approval of fuzzy matches

## Technical Notes

```typescript
interface LookupProcessor {
  processDataWithLookups(
    data: any[],
    targetShape: TargetShape,
    referenceDataManager: ReferenceDataManager
  ): ProcessedLookupResult;

  processSingleLookup(
    value: any,
    field: LookupField,
    referenceData: any[]
  ): LookupResult;

  updateDerivedColumns(
    rowData: any,
    lookupResults: Record<string, LookupResult>
  ): any;
}

interface ProcessedLookupResult {
  data: any[];
  errors: LookupError[];
  stats: LookupStats;
  fuzzyMatches: FuzzyMatch[];
}

interface LookupStats {
  totalFields: number;
  exactMatches: number;
  fuzzyMatches: number;
  noMatches: number;
  derivedColumns: number;
}
```

## Dependencies

- LOOKUP-003 (Target Shapes Integration)
- LOOKUP-004 (Matching Engine)
- Existing data processing pipeline

## Estimated Effort

**Large** (4-5 days)

## Files to Modify

- `lib/utils/data-processing.ts`
- `lib/features/tableSlice.ts`

## Implementation TODOs

### Types & Interfaces

- [x] Define interfaces for all processor components and results
- [x] Create proper error and statistics types
- [x] Add types for batch processing operations
- [x] Ensure compatibility with existing data processing types

### Testing

- [x] Unit tests for lookup processing during data import
- [x] Unit tests for real-time lookup updates
- [x] Unit tests for batch processing with large datasets
- [x] Integration tests with existing data processing pipeline
- [x] Test error handling and recovery scenarios
- [x] Test memory management during processing
- [x] Performance tests with various data sizes

### Documentation

- [x] Document integration with existing data processing flow
- [x] Add JSDoc for all processor methods
- [x] Document performance characteristics and limitations
- [x] Create troubleshooting guide for lookup processing issues

### Redux History Integration

- [x] Add data processing actions to `meaningfulActions` in `lib/store.ts`:
  - `table/processDataWithLookups/fulfilled` (async thunk completion)
  - `table/updateLookupValue/fulfilled` (for real-time updates)
- [x] Ensure lookup processing results are tracked in history
- [x] Test time-travel with processed lookup data
- [x] Verify derived columns restore properly
- [x] Update `lib/utils/time-travel.ts` for lookup data restoration

## Files to Modify

- `lib/utils/data-processing.ts`
- `lib/features/tableSlice.ts`
- `lib/store.ts` (add to meaningfulActions)
- `lib/utils/time-travel.ts` (for restoration)

## Files to Create

- `lib/utils/lookup-processor.ts`
- `lib/utils/lookup-processor.test.ts`

## âœ… COMPLETION STATUS: DONE

**Completed:** 2025-08-04  
**Test Coverage:** 23 comprehensive tests covering all processing scenarios

### Implementation Summary

All acceptance criteria have been successfully implemented:

1. **Data Import Integration** - Automatic lookup processing during data import with derived column generation
2. **Real-time Updates** - Live lookup updates when users edit lookup field values
3. **Batch Processing** - Efficient processing of large datasets with progress tracking and memory management
4. **Error Handling & Reporting** - Comprehensive error collection, statistics, and fuzzy match review

### Key Deliverables

- **Lookup Processor**: `lib/utils/lookup-processor.ts` (600+ lines) with comprehensive LookupProcessor class
- **Redux Integration**: Enhanced `lib/features/tableSlice.ts` with async thunks and state management
- **Test Coverage**: Complete test suite with 23 passing tests covering all functionality
- **Store Integration**: Updated `lib/store.ts` with meaningful actions for history tracking
- **Performance**: Optimized for large datasets with batch processing and progress indicators

### Advanced Features Implemented
