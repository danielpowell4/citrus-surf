# LOOKUP-009: Template Builder Integration

## Context

Integrate lookup fields into the existing template builder UI, allowing users to create and configure lookup fields through the visual target shape builder interface.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Lookup Field Creation in Template Builder
- [x] Add "Lookup" option to field type dropdown in template builder
- [x] Create lookup field configuration form with all necessary options
- [x] Allow users to upload and select reference files during template creation
- [x] Provide preview of lookup field behavior

### AC2: Reference File Management in Builder
- [x] File upload interface for reference data within template builder
- [x] Validation of reference file structure and columns
- [x] Preview of available reference values
- [x] Option to edit reference data inline during template creation

### AC3: Lookup Configuration UI
- [x] Intuitive dropdowns for selecting match columns and return columns
- [x] Smart matching configuration (enable/disable, confidence threshold)
- [x] Derived fields selection with multi-select interface
- [x] Real-time validation of lookup configuration

### AC4: Template Preview with Lookup Fields
- [x] Preview how lookup fields will behave in the final table
- [x] Show derived columns in template preview
- [x] Display reference data source information
- [x] Validate lookup configuration before template save

## Technical Notes

```typescript
interface LookupFieldBuilderProps {
  field: LookupField;
  availableReferenceFiles: ReferenceDataInfo[];
  onFieldChange: (field: LookupField) => void;
  onReferenceUpload: (file: File) => Promise<void>;
}

// Integration points:
// - Template builder form components
// - File upload handling
// - Real-time validation
// - Preview generation
```

## Implementation TODOs

### Types & Interfaces
- [x] Define props interfaces for lookup field builder components
- [x] Create types for reference file selection and validation
- [x] Add proper types for template preview with lookup fields
- [x] Ensure compatibility with existing template builder types

### Testing
- [x] Unit tests for lookup field creation in template builder
- [x] Unit tests for reference file upload and validation
- [x] Unit tests for lookup configuration form validation
- [x] Integration tests with existing template builder
- [x] End-to-end tests for complete lookup template creation workflow

### Documentation
- [x] Update template builder documentation with lookup field creation
- [x] Add user guide for configuring lookup fields in templates
- [x] Document best practices for reference data organization
- [x] Create troubleshooting guide for lookup configuration issues

### Redux History Integration
- [x] Add template builder actions to `meaningfulActions`:
  - `targetShapes/saveTargetShape` (Template builder: Save target shape)
  - `targetShapes/saveTargetShapeAsync/fulfilled` (Template builder: Save target shape async)
  - `targetShapes/updateTargetShape` (Template builder: Update target shape)
  - `targetShapes/deleteTargetShape` (Template builder: Delete target shape)
  - `referenceData/uploadFileSuccess` (Reference data upload)
- [x] Ensure template building with lookup fields is tracked in history
- [x] Test undo/redo functionality during template creation
- [x] Verify that reference file uploads are handled appropriately in history

## Dependencies
- LOOKUP-001 (Core Types)
- LOOKUP-002 (Reference Data Manager)
- Existing template builder system

## Estimated Effort
**Medium** (4-5 days)

## Files to Create
- ~~`app/playground/template-builder/lookup-field-builder.tsx`~~ (Integrated into `target-shape-workflow.tsx`)
- ~~`app/playground/template-builder/lookup-field-builder.test.tsx`~~ (Created as `lookup-field-builder.test.tsx`)
- ~~`app/playground/template-builder/reference-file-uploader.tsx`~~ (Integrated into `LookupConfiguration` component)
- ~~`components/lookup-configuration-form.tsx`~~ (Integrated into `target-shape-workflow.tsx`)
- ~~`components/lookup-configuration-form.test.tsx`~~ (Covered in workflow tests)

**Actually Created:**
- `app/playground/lookup-field-builder.test.tsx` - Unit tests for lookup field functionality
- `app/playground/target-shape-workflow.test.tsx` - Comprehensive workflow tests
- `lib/utils/lookup-navigation.ts` - Navigation utilities for lookup workflows
- `lib/utils/lookup-navigation.test.ts` - Tests for navigation utilities

## Files to Modify
- [x] `app/playground/template-builder/page.tsx` - Added breadcrumb navigation
- [x] `app/playground/target-shape-workflow.tsx` - **Major implementation** - Added complete lookup field support
- [x] `lib/store.ts` - Added template builder actions to meaningfulActions
- [x] `docs/template-creation-workflow.md` - Updated with lookup field documentation

## Status: âœ… COMPLETED

**Implementation Summary:**
- **Architecture Decision**: Instead of creating separate components, integrated lookup functionality directly into the existing `TargetShapeWorkflow` component for better cohesion and user experience
- **Core Implementation**: Created `LookupConfiguration` component within the workflow that handles all lookup field configuration
- **File Upload**: Integrated reference data upload directly in the template builder using existing `referenceDataManager`
- **Preview Enhancement**: Enhanced the review step to show comprehensive lookup field information
- **Redux Integration**: Added proper history tracking for template builder actions
- **Testing**: Created comprehensive test coverage for lookup field creation workflow
- **Documentation**: Updated template creation documentation with lookup field guidance

**Key Features Delivered:**
1. **Seamless Integration** - Lookup fields work exactly like other field types in the template builder
2. **Reference Data Management** - Upload and manage reference files directly within template creation
3. **Advanced Configuration** - Full support for match configuration, fuzzy matching, and derived fields
4. **Rich Preview** - Detailed preview showing exactly how lookup fields will behave
5. **History Support** - All template operations properly tracked for undo/redo functionality
