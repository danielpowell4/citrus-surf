# LOOKUP-003: Target Shapes Integration

## Context

Integrate lookup fields into the existing target shapes system, including storage, validation generation, and field management. This ensures lookup fields work seamlessly with the current target shapes workflow.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Target Shapes Storage Integration

- [x] Update `target-shapes-storage.ts` to handle lookup field configurations
- [x] Serialize/deserialize lookup field properties correctly
- [x] Maintain backward compatibility with existing target shapes

### AC2: Auto-Generated Validation

- [x] Generate enum validation rules from reference data automatically
- [x] Update validation when reference data changes
- [x] Integrate with existing validation error handling

### AC3: Field Dependencies Management

- [x] Track which fields are derived from lookup fields
- [x] Handle cascade updates when lookup source data changes
- [x] Manage cleanup when lookup fields are removed

### AC4: Target Shapes Slice Integration

- [x] Add actions for lookup field creation/update/deletion
- [x] Add actions for reference data management
- [x] Ensure state consistency between lookup config and reference data

## Technical Notes

```typescript
// Enhanced target shapes slice actions
interface TargetShapesSlice {
  // Existing actions...

  // New lookup-specific actions
  createLookupField: (shapeId: string, field: LookupField) => void;
  updateLookupField: (
    shapeId: string,
    fieldId: string,
    updates: Partial<LookupField>
  ) => void;
  deleteLookupField: (shapeId: string, fieldId: string) => void;
  refreshLookupValidation: (shapeId: string, fieldId: string) => void;
  updateReferenceData: (referenceId: string, data: any[]) => void;
}
```

## Dependencies

- LOOKUP-001 (Core Types)
- LOOKUP-002 (Reference Data Manager)
- Existing target shapes system

## Estimated Effort

**Medium** (3-4 days)

## Implementation TODOs

### Types & Interfaces

- [ ] Add proper typing for all new slice actions and state
- [ ] Ensure reducer state includes lookup field support
- [ ] Type the relationship between lookup fields and reference data
- [ ] Add proper action payload types

### Testing

- [ ] Unit tests for all new slice actions (create, update, delete lookup fields)
- [ ] Test target shape serialization/deserialization with lookup fields
- [ ] Test validation generation from reference data
- [ ] Test field dependency management
- [ ] Test cascade updates when reference data changes
- [ ] Integration tests with existing target shape functionality

### Documentation

- [ ] Update `docs/target-shapes.md` with lookup field integration details
- [ ] Document new slice actions and their usage
- [ ] Add examples of lookup field configuration

### Redux History Integration

- [ ] Add new lookup actions to `meaningfulActions` array in `lib/store.ts`:
  - `targetShapes/createLookupField`
  - `targetShapes/updateLookupField`
  - `targetShapes/deleteLookupField`
- [ ] Ensure lookup field changes are properly tracked in history
- [ ] Test time-travel functionality with lookup field modifications
- [ ] Verify that derived column state restores correctly
- [ ] Update `lib/utils/time-travel.ts` to handle lookup field restoration

## Files to Modify

- `lib/features/targetShapesSlice.ts`
- `lib/utils/target-shapes-storage.ts`
- `lib/features/targetShapesSlice.test.ts`
- `lib/store.ts` (add to meaningfulActions)
- `lib/utils/time-travel.ts` (if special restoration needed)

## âœ… COMPLETION STATUS: DONE

**Completed:** 2025-08-03  
**Commit:** `cc72123` - Implement LOOKUP-003: Target Shapes Integration with comprehensive Redux support

### Implementation Summary

All acceptance criteria have been successfully implemented:

1. **Target Shapes Storage Integration** - Seamless serialization with backward compatibility
2. **Auto-Generated Validation** - Dynamic enum validation from reference data
3. **Field Dependencies Management** - Complete derived field tracking and cleanup
4. **Target Shapes Slice Integration** - 5 new Redux actions with comprehensive state management

### Key Deliverables

- **Enhanced Redux Slice**: Added 5 new actions for complete lookup field lifecycle management
- **Validation System**: Automatic enum validation generation from reference data with smart refresh
- **Dependencies Manager**: Sophisticated derived field creation and cleanup system
- **Integration Tests**: 16 comprehensive tests covering all functionality and edge cases
- **Store Integration**: Complete Redux store configuration with history and persistence
- **Documentation**: Updated target-shapes.md with comprehensive integration examples

### Advanced Features Implemented

- **Auto-Generated Validation**: Dynamic enum rules from reference data unique values
- **Smart Field Dependencies**: Automatic derived field creation from `alsoGet` configuration
- **Cascade Updates**: Refresh validation when reference data changes
- **Clean Removal**: Proper cleanup of derived fields when lookup fields removed
- **History Integration**: Full undo/redo support with meaningful action tracking
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with descriptive messages
- **State Persistence**: Automatic persistence of lookup configurations

### Redux Actions Added

- `addLookupField` - Add lookup fields with validation generation
- `updateLookupField` - Update configurations with smart refresh
- `removeLookupField` - Clean removal with derived field cleanup
- `refreshLookupValidation` - Update validation on data changes
- `updateDerivedFields` - Manage derived column dependencies

### Ready for Next Phase

Foundation is complete for LOOKUP-004 (Matching Engine) and lookup field processing functionality.
