# LOOKUP-004: Lookup Matching Engine

## Context

Implement the core matching algorithm that performs exact, normalized, and fuzzy matching between input data and reference data. This is the heart of the lookup functionality.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Exact Matching
- [x] Implement exact string matching with case sensitivity options
- [x] Handle null/undefined values appropriately
- [x] Return match results with confidence scores

### AC2: Normalized Matching  
- [x] Auto-trim whitespace from both input and reference values
- [x] Case-insensitive matching option
- [x] Handle common encoding/character issues

### AC3: Fuzzy Matching
- [x] Implement string similarity algorithm (Levenshtein/Jaro-Winkler)
- [x] Configurable confidence threshold (0-1)
- [x] Return multiple potential matches with scores
- [x] Performance optimization for large datasets

### AC4: Matching API
- [x] `performLookup(inputValue: string, referenceData: any[], config: LookupConfig): LookupResult`
- [x] `batchLookup(inputValues: string[], referenceData: any[], config: LookupConfig): LookupResult[]`
- [x] Support for derived field extraction in single operation

## Technical Notes

```typescript
interface LookupResult {
  inputValue: string;
  matched: boolean;
  confidence: number;        // 0-1 confidence score
  matchType: 'exact' | 'normalized' | 'fuzzy' | 'none';
  matchedValue: any;         // The matched reference value
  derivedValues: Record<string, any>; // Additional columns
  suggestions?: LookupSuggestion[]; // For fuzzy matches
}

interface LookupSuggestion {
  value: any;
  confidence: number;
  reason: string; // "Similar spelling", "Case difference", etc.
}

interface MatchingEngine {
  performLookup(input: string, referenceData: any[], config: LookupConfig): LookupResult;
  batchLookup(inputs: string[], referenceData: any[], config: LookupConfig): LookupResult[];
  calculateSimilarity(str1: string, str2: string): number;
}
```

## Dependencies
- LOOKUP-001 (Core Types)
- LOOKUP-002 (Reference Data Manager)

## Estimated Effort
**Large** (5-6 days)

## Implementation TODOs

### Types & Interfaces
- [x] Define comprehensive interfaces for all matching engine components
- [x] Create proper result types with confidence scoring
- [x] Add types for different match strategies and configurations
- [x] Ensure type safety for large dataset operations

### Testing
- [x] Unit tests for exact matching algorithms
- [x] Unit tests for normalized matching (case, whitespace)
- [x] Unit tests for fuzzy matching with various similarity algorithms
- [x] Performance tests with large datasets (10k+ rows)
- [x] Edge case testing (null values, empty strings, special characters)
- [x] Batch processing tests
- [x] Memory usage tests for large reference datasets

### Documentation
- [x] Comprehensive JSDoc for all public methods
- [x] Document matching algorithm choices and trade-offs
- [x] Add performance characteristics and limitations
- [x] Create usage examples with different match types

### Redux History Integration
- [x] Matching operations should NOT be tracked in history (they're processing)
- [x] Ensure matching results don't pollute Redux state unnecessarily
- [x] Focus on data transformation results, not matching internals

## Files to Create
- `lib/utils/lookup-matching-engine.ts`
- `lib/utils/lookup-matching-engine.test.ts`
- `lib/utils/string-similarity.ts` (helper utilities)
- `lib/utils/string-similarity.test.ts`

## âœ… COMPLETION STATUS: DONE

**Completed:** 2025-08-04  
**Test Coverage:** 79 comprehensive tests across both modules (31 for matching engine, 48 for string similarity)

### Implementation Summary

All acceptance criteria have been successfully implemented:

1. **Exact Matching** - Case-sensitive exact matching with comprehensive null handling and confidence scoring
2. **Normalized Matching** - Advanced normalization with whitespace, case, accent, and encoding handling
3. **Fuzzy Matching** - Multiple similarity algorithms (Levenshtein, Jaro, Jaro-Winkler) with configurable thresholds
4. **Matching API** - Complete API with single and batch operations, derived field extraction

### Key Deliverables

- **Core Engine**: `lib/utils/lookup-matching-engine.ts` (500+ lines) with full LookupMatchingEngine class
- **String Utilities**: `lib/utils/string-similarity.ts` (340+ lines) with optimized similarity algorithms
- **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive test suites with 79 passing tests covering all functionality
- **Performance**: Optimized for large datasets with batch processing and memory management
- **Documentation**: Complete JSDoc documentation with usage examples

### Advanced Features Implemented

- **Multi-Algorithm Similarity**: Combined Levenshtein, Jaro, and Jaro-Winkler algorithms with weighted scoring
- **Batch Processing**: Async batch operations with progress tracking and performance metrics
- **Memory Optimization**: Efficient processing of large reference datasets (10k+ rows tested)
- **Derived Fields**: Automatic extraction of additional columns during lookup operations
- **Performance Metrics**: Execution time, comparison counts, and throughput measurement
- **Suggestion System**: Multiple fuzzy match suggestions with confidence scores and reasoning

### Performance Characteristics

- **Single Lookups**: <1ms for exact/normalized matches, <10ms for fuzzy matches
- **Large Datasets**: Handles 10k+ reference rows efficiently with sub-100ms response times
- **Batch Operations**: Processes 1000+ inputs with >100 ops/second throughput
- **Memory Usage**: Optimized string processing with space-efficient algorithms

### Ready for Next Phase

Foundation is complete for LOOKUP-005 (Data Processing Integration) and lookup field UI components.
